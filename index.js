// code your solution here
// Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:


const superbowlWin = (records) => {
    const win = records.find(record => record.result === "W")
    return win ? win.year : undefined
} 

// if (win) {
//     return win.year
// } else {
//     return undefined
// }

superbowlWin(record);

// The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
// Each object has two properties: year and result
// It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
// It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
// If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined
